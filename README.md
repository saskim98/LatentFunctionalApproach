Title: A Latent Functional Approach for Modeling the Effects of Multi-Dimensional Exposures on Disease Risk

PesticideF.f: Main code for saving all MCMC outputs and calling the subroutines for MCMC sampling algorithm

PesticideF_Gibbs.f: all subrountines for MCMC sampling algorithm

nAHSData.txt and nUniqueDuration.txt: Dataset

hpd.f, optim1.f, rGiGDis.f, and tnorm.f: auxiliary files

To run the code, 1) compile PesticideF.f and make exe file, 2) run the exe file
